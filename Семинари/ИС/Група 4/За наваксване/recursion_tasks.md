## Learning Objectives

By completing these tasks, you will develop instinctive understanding of:
- Base cases and recursive cases
- Function call stack behavior
- Recursion vs iteration trade-offs
- Tail recursion optimization opportunities
- Backtracking algorithms
- Divide and conquer strategies
- Memoization and dynamic programming
- Tree recursion patterns
- Mutual recursion
- Recursion on different data structures (arrays, strings, trees)
- Stack overflow risks and prevention
- Converting recursive to iterative solutions

**Practice Tip:** For each task, identify the base case(s) first, then the recursive case. Draw recursion trees for complex problems. Start simple and build up to backtracking algorithms. Repetition will make recursive thinking natural.

**Warning:** Be careful with tasks like Fibonacci without memoization - they can be exponentially slow. This is intentional to understand the importance of optimization.
